config DEEP_PROBE_DEFAULT
	bool "Probe devices recursively on-demand"
	help
          The barebox 'deep probe' or 'probe on demand' mechanism gets
          rid of the EPROBE_DEFER error code from probes by reordering
          the device population and the driver registration.
          All drivers are registered first and afterwards devices are
          populated. When a device probing requires a resource that's
          not yet available, the device providing that resource is probed
          recursively, hence the probe callstack gets deeper until all
          resources are available.

          This changes the order in which drivers are initialized, which
          can unearth bugs in drivers. Board code that makes use of
          different initcall levels to interleave with driver probes
          will behave differently.

          If unsure and you want to fix implicit assumptions that may
          break your startup, say 'y'.
          If unsure and you want deep probe to only be enabled
          explicitly per top-level machine compatible, say 'n'.
